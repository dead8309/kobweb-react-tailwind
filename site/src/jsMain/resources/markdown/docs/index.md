An unofficial, [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) port of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). This is not affiliated with [shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn) but inspired by him. This is a project born out of the need for a similar project for the KotlinJs ecosystem.

{{{ .docs.index.Callout() }}}

This is a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can add to your apps.

**What do you mean a component library? Is it different from original project?**

It means you have to install it as a dependency. It is published on maven-central. You get all the components you need in a single library.

_Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries._
